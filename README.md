# Would You Rather?

## TL;DR
To get started developing right away:
* make sure you are running the right version of `node` and `npm`, as declared in the file `package.json > engines` (`node >= 12.20.0`, `npm >= 6.14.8`)
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## The mock Backend Server

To simplify development process, I've developed a mock backend server functions at the `src/backend` folder.
The files in the `backend` folder contains all the backend logic needed to handle application data, authentication...

## Rubrics checklist:
Beside of developing against the base requirements of the project, I've developed some more functionalities like:
* A `user can register a new account` to be able to login
* Application `authentication using JWT mechanism`, tokens will have expiration time as 30 minutes (as configured in the .env file)
* User `can view their profile page, pick a new avatar image` in a predefined list or upload their own image from computer
* `A loading progress bar will be shown` each time the application being redirected to a different page
* Users can `switch between light and dark themes`, or using default system theme of their computer
* At home page, `users can view their created questions` at the `Created` tab
